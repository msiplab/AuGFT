-- Abstract: This paper proposes a method for designing directed graph (digraph) filters through a dictionary learning approach. Practical digraph filtering methods have not yet been established because of the difficulties posed by asymmetry of the adjacency matrix of a digraph. Augmented graph Fourier transform (AuGFT), proposed by Kitamura et al., defines a new graph Laplacian and extends the conventional graph Fourier transform (GFT) for undirected graph signals to directed ones. However, challenges remain in filter design through AuGFT, particularly in determining the skew intensity parameters. Therefore, this study aims to establish a design method for digraph filters with AuGFT. Filters are parameterized with AuGFT, and parameter optimization is performed using a dictionary learning technique. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experimental results of digraph filtering are shown for temperature data of contiguous US and the GSP-traffic-dataset. Compared with undirected graph filtering, the proposed method is shown to have high steerability in designing digraph filters.

-- Abstract: This study proposes a filtering method for directed graph (digraph) signals. In order to realize digraph filtering, a novel graph Fourier transform (GFT), – Augmented GFT (AuGFT) –, is proposed by defining an Hermitian adjacency matrix. Although there has been the same method to give the adjacency matrix of digraphs, this study defines a novel digraph Laplacian. The existing digraph Laplacian does not give the graph signal variation considering the edge directions, while the novel one does. This paper introduces three important ideas. The first is the definition of a novel degree matrix to give the novel digraph Laplacian. The second is to decompose the symmetric and skew-symmetric components of the novel digraph Laplacian independently into their spectral components. The third is, based on the decomposition, to augment the conventional GFT for digraphs as an invertible real-valued dictionary. The new GFT is shown to provide a practical form of real-valued digraph filtering. The significance of the proposed method is verified through simulations of signal filtering on digraphs.
